# Useful-Policy-Invariant-Shaping-from-Arbitrary-Advice
This repository contains some of the codes from the paper [Useful Policy Invariant Shaping from Arbitrary Advice](https://ala2020.vub.ac.be/papers/ALA2020_paper_30.pdf).
## Run an experiment
You can run a specific experiment by running the experiment.py. In order to specify the experiment details such as the environment, the agent, learning parameters, etc., you can pass the name of your desired block from the experimental_config.ini to the config parser. We used a modified version of RL-GLUE tfor handling the agent and environemnt interactions.[[1]](#1)
